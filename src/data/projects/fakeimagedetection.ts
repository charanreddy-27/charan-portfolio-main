    overview:
      "The Fake Image Detection project leverages convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to analyze and classify images as real or manipulated. The system processes images using OpenCV for preprocessing, trains a deep learning model with Keras and TensorFlow, and evaluates its performance on benchmark datasets. Visualization and result analysis are conducted in Jupyter Notebooks using Matplotlib.",
    challenges: [
      "Curating and preprocessing large datasets of both real and fake images for effective training.",
      "Designing an accurate architecture capable of distinguishing subtle manipulations in images.",
      "Avoiding overfitting while ensuring generalization across various image sources and manipulation types.",
      "Achieving high detection accuracy and low false positives in real-world scenarios."
    ],
    solution:
      "The project implements a deep CNN trained on datasets containing authentic and manipulated images. Data augmentation and image preprocessing techniques are applied to improve robustness. The model is evaluated using cross-validation and tested on unseen data. Interpretability is enhanced through visualization of feature maps and prediction results.",
    outcome:
      "The Fake Image Detection system achieved significant accuracy in identifying manipulated images, demonstrating potential for integration into digital forensics and social media platforms. The approach showcases the effectiveness of deep learning for image authenticity verification.",
